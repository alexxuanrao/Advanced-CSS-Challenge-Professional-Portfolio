            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a good-natured, naive, and enthusiastic sea sponge that lives in a pineapple with my pet snail, Gary, in the city of Bikini Bottom on the floor of the Pacific Ocean. I work as a fry cook at the Krusty Krab.

            <h2>MY TIME AT KRUSTY KRAB</h2>
            <p>
                I'm not only extremely good at my job, being able to produce a Krabby Patty within seconds, but also has a strong passion and an abnormal love for it; something of a workaholic, I enjoy my job more than any other activity and is saddened whenever I cannot be at work. I even view closing time as the saddest part of the day.

            <h2>PERSONALITY</h2>
            <p>
                I'm cheerful, good-natured and always happy to help anyone. I'm kind to everyone and is determined to be friends with those around me. When it comes to doing a job SpongeBob completes it to the best of my ability, and gets extremely upset with myself if I fail to do something right. I'm generally a happy-go-lucky character and is friendly to everyone.
