# Module 2 Challenge
# Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio

## User Story
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
📝 I deployed the link on GitHub and created a new repository.

THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
📝 For the navigation bar, I included 3 items to introduce the employee’s background, work history, and personality. A recent photo is included in the hero section

WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
📝 Items in the navigation bar leads users to corresponding section by adding an “id” to each of them. 

WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications 
📝 I included images in each section. 

WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
📝 Hero image is larger than the others

WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
📝 I used hover to all 3 main body sections

WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
📝 Flexbox is applied to the head and the body sections
